              the liberation genealogy project (lgp) is a movement. we're committed to gathering black people of african descent in pittsburgh and beyond, of all ages and backgrounds to reclaim our narratives. we believe our ancestors include those of blood and spirit, those chosen, and biological. we recognize the unique challenges black genealogy presents, and we create space to learn together and provide support and resources to navigate what arises.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              more than a workshop, lgp is a community rooted in spirituality, process, and ancestor reverence. a deep sense of gratitude to our ancestors of blood and spirit guides our work. we acknowledge the sacrifices they made and the legacy they left behind. their stories are woven into the very fabric of who we are.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              we wouldn't be here without the incredible support of <strong>Opportunity Fund</strong> and the <strong>Pittsburgh Cultural Trust</strong>, <strong>Autumn Redcross</strong> (genealogical research), <strong>Shirley Salmon-Davis, PhD</strong> (mental health support), <strong>James Scott</strong> (chief of all things). and <strong>Njaimeh Njie</strong> (multimedia artist/collage workshop), their contributions are invaluable.
